When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
for sharing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    so that we get control over it, so that we can pull whenever we want to

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   forks: copying other person's project and adding a copy in our github account and modifying our copy as required.
   clones: creating a copy of the project in local which includes all commit history of project
   branch: creating a copy of the project to work in local to work on it. Later need to stage and commit it to create a commit log. And later need to push it to remote to create a commit log in remote github account

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can compare and merge when we want it rather than merging it right away if i am busy and dont have time to analyze and i also will not have internet access in sometime.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    its very difficult to colloborate without git or github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    so that we can get it reviwed by others via PRs. Also if more than one person is working on updating master then working on separate branch is right thing so that we can colloborate well
